Purpose: this task is part of translating the user interface of a desktop application called "Geometrize". The app reconstructs images using only simple geometric shapes (circles, triangles, rectangles etc).


Useful links and info:

This webpage has screenshots of every part of the Geometrize user interface, in English. This should provide some useful context: http://screenshots.geometrize.co.uk/

If what the app does is unclear, please see this web-based example that recreates images using shapes. In this case, a seagull is recreated using triangles: http://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/geometrize-haxe-web/

Alternatively, here is an example screenshot of what the app does to an image: https://imgur.com/a/67JiT

Specific instructions:

Wherever an appropriate translation was not obvious from the context/information provided, please indicate this in feedback if possible.

Do not translate replacement symbols such as "%1", "%2" or "%3". These are replaced by other strings in the app at runtime. For example, "Image width: %1 pixels" could become "Image width: 800 pixels".

Do not translate the file extensions in strings containing file extensions. For example, in "JPEG Image (*.jpg)", "(*.jpg)" should not be translated.

Thank you very much!
